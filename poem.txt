Monday comes, and we all groan,
The weekend's gone, and we're alone,
Back to work, back to school,
The daily grind, it can be cruel.

Tuesday's here, and we're still blue,
The week stretches out, so much to do,
The weekend's far, it's hard to see,
The light at the end of this misery.

Wednesday's known as hump day,
Halfway there, we start to say,
The end is near, we're almost free,
Just a few more days, and we'll be happy.

Thursday's here, and we feel fine,
The weekend's close, it's just in sight,
We've almost made it, we're almost there,
Just one more day, and we'll be there.

Friday's come, and we all cheer,
The weekend's here, it's finally here,
We can relax, we can have fun,
The week is over, our work is done.

Saturday's great, it's time to play,
No work, no school, just fun all day,
We can sleep in, we can stay out late,
We can enjoy ourselves, it's time to celebrate.

Sunday's here, and we wind down,
The weekend's over, we're back in town,
We rest, we relax, we prepare for the week,
We take a deep breath, and we start to speak.

Monday comes, and we begin again,
The cycle repeats, it never ends,
But we know we'll make it, we'll be okay,
We'll get through the week, day by day.
